# 🔐 Security Policy

## Supported Versions
This is an active project under development. Please report security issues against the `main` branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability (Private)
**Do not** open a public issue for security vulnerabilities.

Instead, use **GitHub’s private reporting**:
- Go to the repository’s **Security** tab → **Report a vulnerability**, or visit the repository’s **Advisories** page and click **Report a vulnerability**.
- Provide clear steps to reproduce, impact, and any suggested fixes.

If private reporting is unavailable for any reason, you may open a minimal public issue that says “Security report sent privately” (no details), and the maintainer will follow up.

## What to Include
- Affected files/paths and steps to reproduce
- Expected vs. actual behavior
- Environment details (browser/version)
- Any PoC you can safely share privately

## Response & Disclosure
- We’ll acknowledge your report within **7 days**.
- We aim to provide a remediation plan or fix within **30 days**, depending on severity.
- After a fix is released, we’ll coordinate a safe disclosure window if needed.

## Out of Scope (for this project)
- Clickjacking/UI issues requiring cross-origin framing
- Issues requiring privileged local device access or browser extensions
- Social engineering or non-project infrastructure
