# Changelog — Readr
All notable changes to **Readr** (reading log app) will be documented in this file.

The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/), and we aim to follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **CHANGELOG.md** to track notable changes.
- **README**: Community badges for Contributing, Code of Conduct, and “Security: Report a Vulnerability”.
- **Security policy**: Rules of Engagement, Severity & Target Timelines table, In-Scope/Out-of-Scope examples, Safe Harbor, Researcher Credit, and CVE/advisory note; added Table of Contents.
- **Bug report template**: Security note + advisory link, Console/Network capture, Sample Data (import/export), Severity, Reproducibility, Workaround, Related Issues/PRs, Additional Context.
- **Feature request template**: Non-Goals, User Story, Acceptance Criteria, optional UI/UX section, Data Model/Storage changes, Success Metrics, A11y & Security considerations, Risks/Dependencies, Scope/Size estimate, Release Notes, and checklist items (docs + CHANGELOG).
- **PR template**: Links to README/CONTRIBUTING, Breaking changes prompt, expanded change types (e.g., Refactor/Chore), checklist items for a11y, security considerations, and CHANGELOG updates.
- **Project Structure (README)** now lists `CHANGELOG.md`.

### Changed
- **Naming**: Standardized on “**Readr — Reading Log App**” (first mention), then “Readr”.

- **Issue/PR templates**: Headings and wording updated to say “in Readr”; consistent em-dash style; added quick links to README/CONTRIBUTING.

### Fixed
- Broken relative links in PR template (`../` instead of `../../`).
- Typos (e.g., “reporoduce”→“reproduce”, “phising”→“phishing”, “degredation”→“degradation”, “ad”→“add”).
- Quotation mark in “Workaround: None”.
- “Self-XSS” capitalization; minor punctuation and spacing.

### Security
- Documented **private vulnerability reporting via GitHub Security Advisories** (`/security/advisories/new`) instead of email.
