# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development priorities for **Readr**.
It balances the current lightweight version with a clear path toward a full-stack MERN application.

---

## 🎯 Goals

- Provide a minimal, offline-first reading log (v1.0).
- Gradually evolve into a MERN-based app with cloud sync and advanced features.
- Maintain clarity and simplicity at each stage.

### 🎨 Version 1.9 — Visualization & Motivation

- [ ] Basic charts (per-book progress, per-day trends)
  - _AC_: User can view charts generated from session data; includes per-book progress + per-day/weekly trend; charts update automatically when sessions change; supports light/dark mode.
- [ ] Badges for hitting goals (light gamification)

- [ ] Keyboard shortcuts for quick session logging
  - _AC_: User can open New Session with a shortcut (e.g., `N`), navigate Session History rows with arrows + Enter, and toggle shortcuts in Settings for accessibility.
- [ ] Shareable progress snapshot
  - _AC_: User can export/share an image containing reading streak, book progress, and earned badges; snapshot uses a branded layout and works in PWA and browser.
- [ ] A11y: charts + badges readable without visuals
  - _AC_: Charts include alt-text summaries (“Reading increased 15% week-over-week”); badges have ARIA labels; shareable snapshot generates a text-based equivalent.
- [ ] Chart themes (optional aesthetic/accent modes)
  - _AC_: User can toggle light, dark, and monochrome chart themes; themes persist and respect system settings.
- [ ] Trend ranges (weekly, monthly, yearly)

- [ ] Cleanup & structure: charts + badges modules
  - _AC_: Add `features/charts.js`, `features/badges.js`, and reusable `<chart-container>` UI; remove old streak logic replaced by analytics layer.

Planned Q4 2025

### 🚀 Version 2.0 — React Frontend (MERN Start)

- [ ] CI: type check (optional TS), lint, unit tests on PRs
      _AC:_ `npm test` passes locally; `npm run lint` or precommit hooks catch obvious issues.

Planned: Q4 2025

### 🌐 Version 2.1 — Express API + MongoDB

- [ ] Setup Node/Express backend
      _AC:_ `npm start` serves `/health` → 200 JSON `{status:"ok"}`.

## 🔮 Long-Term Ideas

- Tags and categories for books
  _AC:_ User can add/remove free-form tags and select one category per book.
  _AC:_ Tags autocomplete from existing tags; new tags can be created inline.
  _AC:_ Filter panel supports multi-select by tags and single-select by category.
  _AC:_ Tag and category choices persist across app reloads and appear in backups/exports.
  _AC:_ Bulk edit lets user add/remove a tag to multiple selected books.
  _AC:_ A11y: tag editor is fully keyboard-operable (Tab, Enter to confirm, Backspace to remove); screen readers announce “tag added/removed”.

- Statistics dashboard (books read per month, genres, etc.)
  _AC:_ Dashboard shows monthly books read, total pages/minutes, top genres, average session length for a selected time range.
  _AC:_ Time range selector supports presets (This month, Last 3 months, Year to date) and custom dates.
  _AC:_ Metrics update instantly when the range changes (≤150ms on typical datasets).
  _AC:_ Clicking a metric or chart segment deep-links to the filtered Books/Sessions view.
  _AC:_ Data remains correct after import/migration; missing fields are handled gracefully (excluded and noted).
  _AC:_ A11y: each card has an accessible name/description; charts include text summaries for screen readers.

- Data visualization (charts of reading progress)
  _AC:_ Provide at least these charts: Line (daily/weekly reading time or pages), Bar (books completed per month), Donut/Pie (genre distribution).
  _AC:_ Hover tooltips show exact values; legends toggle series on/off.
  _AC:_ Export chart image (PNG/SVG) and data (CSV) per chart.
  _AC:_ Charts reflect active filters (date range, tags, category, status).
  _AC:_ Performance: charts render ≤300ms for 2k+ sessions on mid-range devices.
  _AC:_ A11y: keyboard focusable data points/legend toggles; “Describe chart” text available for screen readers.

- Export to additional formats (CSV, Markdown, PDF)
  _AC:_ Export dialog lets user choose CSV, Markdown, or PDF, with scope options: Books, Sessions, or Both.
  _AC:_ CSV uses stable headers and UTF-8; Markdown includes readable tables and totals; PDF is paginated with header/footer & date range.
  _AC:_ Exports respect active filters and selected time range.
  _AC:_ File names include app name, data type, and ISO date (e.g., readr-books-2025-10-01.csv).
  _AC:_ Large exports (5k+ rows) stream or chunk without freezing UI; user sees progress and success/failure toast.
  _AC:_ A11y: export flow operable with keyboard; buttons have clear labels; progress is announced to screen readers.

- Integration with external APIs (e.g., Goodreads)
  _AC:_ User can connect an external account via OAuth; connection state is visible and revocable.
  _AC:_ After connect, user can import book metadata (title, author, cover, ISBN, genres) and optionally sync reading status.
  _AC:_ Conflicts show a clear merge dialog (keep local / keep remote / merge fields); user choice is remembered per field when selected.
  _AC:_ Rate-limit and error states display actionable messages (retry/backoff) without data loss.
  _AC:_ Privacy: user consent required before any data leaves the device; a clear Disconnect & delete option removes tokens and remote copies if supported.
  _AC:_ A11y: OAuth flow and merge dialogs are labeled, focus-trapped, and fully keyboard accessible.

- Team collaboration features (shared reading groups)
  _AC:_ User can create/join a Group and invite members by link or email.
  _AC:_ Group has shared reading lists, sessions feed, and goal board; each item shows author and timestamp.
  _AC:_ Permissions: Owner/Moderator/Member roles control invite, edit, and delete actions; defaults are least-privilege.
  _AC:_ Presence/conflict: optimistic UI shows edits immediately; concurrent edits resolve with last-writer wins + non-destructive history for recovery.
  _AC:_ Notifications (in-app) for mentions, new sessions on a followed book, and milestone completions; user can mute per group.
  _AC:_ Export honors group scope (own data vs. group aggregate) and redacts private fields when required.
  _AC:_ A11y: all group actions operable via keyboard; live region announces new posts/sessions.

- Offline sync & conflict resolution
  _AC:_ Changes made offline sync automatically when back online.
  _AC:_ Conflict resolution shows clear merge options (keep local/remote/both).
  _AC:_ Sync status visible (Last synced at …).
  _AC:_ A11y: sync indicators have text equivalents for screen readers.
