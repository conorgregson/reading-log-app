# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development priorities for **Readr**.
It balances the current lightweight version with a clear path toward a full-stack MERN application.

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Provide a minimal, offline-first reading log (v1.0).
- Gradually evolve into a MERN-based app with cloud sync and advanced features.
- Maintain clarity and simplicity at each stage.

## 🔮 Long-Term Ideas
- Tags and categories for books  
  _AC:_ User can add/remove free-form tags and select one category per book.  
  _AC:_ Tags autocomplete from existing tags; new tags can be created inline.  
  _AC:_ Filter panel supports multi-select by tags and single-select by category.  
  _AC:_ Tag and category choices persist across app reloads and appear in backups/exports.  
  _AC:_ Bulk edit lets user add/remove a tag to multiple selected books.  
  _AC:_ A11y: tag editor is fully keyboard-operable (Tab, Enter to confirm, Backspace to remove); screen readers announce “tag added/removed”.  

- Statistics dashboard (books read per month, genres, etc.)  
  _AC:_ Dashboard shows monthly books read, total pages/minutes, top genres, average session length for a selected time range.  
  _AC:_ Time range selector supports presets (This month, Last 3 months, Year to date) and custom dates.  
  _AC:_ Metrics update instantly when the range changes (≤150ms on typical datasets).  
  _AC:_ Clicking a metric or chart segment deep-links to the filtered Books/Sessions view.  
  _AC:_ Data remains correct after import/migration; missing fields are handled gracefully (excluded and noted).  
  _AC:_ A11y: each card has an accessible name/description; charts include text summaries for screen readers.  

- Data visualization (charts of reading progress)  
  _AC:_ Provide at least these charts: Line (daily/weekly reading time or pages), Bar (books completed per month), Donut/Pie (genre distribution).  
  _AC:_ Hover tooltips show exact values; legends toggle series on/off.  
  _AC:_ Export chart image (PNG/SVG) and data (CSV) per chart.  
  _AC:_ Charts reflect active filters (date range, tags, category, status).  
  _AC:_ Performance: charts render ≤300ms for 2k+ sessions on mid-range devices.  
  _AC:_ A11y: keyboard focusable data points/legend toggles; “Describe chart” text available for screen readers.  

- Export to additional formats (CSV, Markdown, PDF)  
  _AC:_ Export dialog lets user choose CSV, Markdown, or PDF, with scope options: Books, Sessions, or Both.  
  _AC:_ CSV uses stable headers and UTF-8; Markdown includes readable tables and totals; PDF is paginated with header/footer & date range.  
  _AC:_ Exports respect active filters and selected time range.  
  _AC:_ File names include app name, data type, and ISO date (e.g., readr-books-2025-10-01.csv).  
  _AC:_ Large exports (5k+ rows) stream or chunk without freezing UI; user sees progress and success/failure toast.  
  _AC:_ A11y: export flow operable with keyboard; buttons have clear labels; progress is announced to screen readers.  

- Integration with external APIs (e.g., Goodreads)  
  _AC:_ User can connect an external account via OAuth; connection state is visible and revocable.  
  _AC:_ After connect, user can import book metadata (title, author, cover, ISBN, genres) and optionally sync reading status.  
  _AC:_ Conflicts show a clear merge dialog (keep local / keep remote / merge fields); user choice is remembered per field when selected.  
  _AC:_ Rate-limit and error states display actionable messages (retry/backoff) without data loss.  
  _AC:_ Privacy: user consent required before any data leaves the device; a clear Disconnect & delete option removes tokens and remote copies if supported.  
  _AC:_ A11y: OAuth flow and merge dialogs are labeled, focus-trapped, and fully keyboard accessible.  

- Team collaboration features (shared reading groups)  
  _AC:_ User can create/join a Group and invite members by link or email.  
  _AC:_ Group has shared reading lists, sessions feed, and goal board; each item shows author and timestamp.  
  _AC:_ Permissions: Owner/Moderator/Member roles control invite, edit, and delete actions; defaults are least-privilege.  
  _AC:_ Presence/conflict: optimistic UI shows edits immediately; concurrent edits resolve with last-writer wins + non-destructive history for recovery.  
  _AC:_ Notifications (in-app) for mentions, new sessions on a followed book, and milestone completions; user can mute per group.  
  _AC:_ Export honors group scope (own data vs. group aggregate) and redacts private fields when required.  
  _AC:_ A11y: all group actions operable via keyboard; live region announces new posts/sessions.  

- Offline sync & conflict resolution  
  _AC:_ Changes made offline sync automatically when back online.

  _AC:_ Books can be marked as “Audiobook” or “Other media type”.  
  _AC:_ Session logging supports listening time alongside pages/minutes.  
  _AC:_ Stats and charts include listening data in totals.

  _AC:_ User can define custom fields (e.g., translator, edition, language).  
  _AC:_ Fields are included in add/edit dialogs, exports, and filters.  
  _AC:_ Templates allow reusing field sets when adding similar books.  

- Reading challenges & public profiles  
  _AC:_ User can set public yearly challenges (e.g., “Read 20 books in 2026”).  
  _AC:_ Public profile URL shows selected stats/goals.  
  _AC:_ Privacy controls let user toggle what’s visible (books, sessions, goals).  

- AI-powered insights (optional)  
  _AC:_ Generate summaries of reading habits (e.g., “Most active on Sundays”).  
  _AC:_ Suggest books based on tags, genres, and past completions.  
  _AC:_ Recommendations explain *why* (transparent reasoning).  
  _AC:_ Opt-in only; clear toggle to disable insights.
