# Roadmap

This roadmap outlines the development priorities for **Readr**.
It balances the current lightweight version with a clear path toward a full-stack MERN application.

---

## üéØ Goals
- Provide a minimal, offline-first reading log (v1.0).
- Gradually evolve into a MERN-based app with cloud sync and advanced features.
- Maintain clarity and simplicity at each stage.

## üìå Milestones

### ‚úÖ Version 1.0 ‚Äî Core MVP Release
- [x] Core CRUD (Add books, display list)

- [x] Persist data in localStorage  
  _AC:_ Books remain after closing/reopening browser.
- [x] Seed data for demos  
  _AC:_ Demo books show up on first use.
- [x] SemVer release tagging

### üöÄ Version 2.0 ‚Äî React Frontend (MERN Start)
- [ ] Scaffold React app (with JSX)  
  _AC:_ `npm run dev` starts without errors; root component renders; README has ‚ÄúHow to run."
- [ ] Port Add/Import/Export as React components  
  _AC:_ All three features behave the same as v1.0.0; import rejects invalid JSON.
- [ ] Choose styling framework (Bootstrap or Tailwind; match teal theme)  
  _AC:_ One shared Button (or Card) component implemented; teal `#008080` used consistently.
- [ ] CI: type check (optional TS), lint, unit tests on PRs  
  _AC:_ `npm test` passes locally; `npm run lint` or precommit hooks catch obvious issues.

Planned: Q4 2025

### üåê Version 2.1 ‚Äî Express API + MongoDB
- [ ] Setup Node/Express backend  
  _AC:_ `npm start` serves `/health` ‚Üí 200 JSON `{status:"ok"}`.

  _AC:_ Schema includes: title, author, status, createdAt; rejects empty title/author.
- [ ] CRUD API routes for books (+ pagination)  
  _AC:_ POST/GET/PUT/DELETE return proper status codes; GET supports `?page=&limit=`.
- [ ] Connect React frontend to API  
  _AC:_ List loads from API; adding a book updates UI without manual refresh.
- [ ] Import/Export via API  
  _AC:_ POST `/import` accepts backup JSON; GET `/export` returns current books.
- [ ] Security baseline: HTTPS-only doc + Helmet/CORS/rate limiting  
  _AC:_ Helmet enabled, CORS restricted to frontend URL, basic rate limiting applied.

Planned: Q1 2026

- [ ] Secure routes and API access  
  _AC:_ Auth middleware validates tokens; refresh/expiry rules documented.
- [ ] Token storage strategy documented  
  _AC:_ One-paragraph note in README explains where tokens live (cookie vs storage) and why.

Planned: Q2 2026

### üé® Version 2.3 ‚Äî UI & Experience

- [ ] Deploy frontend (Netlify or Vercel)  
  _AC:_ Public URL loads app and communicates with live API.
- [ ] Environment variable setup for API URLs  
  _AC:_ No hard-coded localhost in production build; README lists `.env` keys.

## üîÆ Long-Term Ideas
- Tags and categories for books
- Statistics dashboard (books read per month, genres, etc.)
- Data visualization (charts of reading progress)
- Export to additional formats (CSV, Markdown, PDF)
- Integration with external APIs (e.g., Goodreads)
- Team collaboration features (shared reading groups)
